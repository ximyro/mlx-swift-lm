/// Pre-load heuristics for deciding whether a model identifier looks like a

/// This is a standalone, opt-in helper — nothing in `MLXLMCommon` calls it.
/// It exists for callers that need to guess reasoning capability from a repo
/// id alone (e.g. before any model files are downloaded, when no other signal
/// is available). Callers that have a stronger signal, or that simply declare
/// their capabilities explicitly, should not use it.
///
/// It is intentionally NOT a provable superset of what actually resolves at load
/// time: a model's own ``ChatConventionsProviding`` declaration keys on the model
/// type, which this heuristic never sees. A community re-upload with a
/// non-matching repo name but a reasoning model type resolves a
/// `ReasoningConfig` yet may not match here. Callers who need a stricter
/// guarantee should declare `.reasoning` themselves.
