/// implementations inherit weight loading and `sanitize` hooks while defining
/// their own forward signature.
///
/// MTP drafters do **not** conform to `LanguageModel` — their I/O contract is
/// different: a drafter consumes the target's last hidden state and per
/// layer-type shared K/V, produces a block of K-1 candidate tokens in a
/// single call, and does not store transient round-state on the model object.
/// The `MTPSpeculativeTokenIterator` extracts the shared K/V from the
/// target's `LMOutput.state` and threads it to the drafter as a method
/// argument.
///
/// Conforming types are expected to be stateless with respect to the target
/// model: every per-round input — including the target itself — flows through
/// `draftBlock(...)` as a method parameter. This makes drafter instances safe
/// to share across iterators without per-iterator mutable state on the model
/// instance. Drafters that need their own per-stream state additionally
/// conform to ``StatefulMTPDrafterModel``.
