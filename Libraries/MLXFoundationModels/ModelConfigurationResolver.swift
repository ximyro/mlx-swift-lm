/// The configuration seam for ``MLXLanguageModel``: adjust the loaded,
/// already-inferred ``ModelConfiguration`` for a model on a per-call basis.
///
/// `LLMModelFactory._load` fully resolves reasoning, tool-call format, and eos
/// tokens (consulting `ChatConventionsRegistry` with the load-bearing `modelId`,
/// then the model's own declaration) before the adapter runs, so the
/// configuration handed to ``resolve(_:for:)`` is already complete. A resolver
/// patches a per-call copy; it does not perform inference.
///
/// - Important: The returned value is consumed as a per-call local. It is
///   **never** written back to `context.configuration`, `Executor.Configuration`,
///   or any cache, so two instances with the same id but different resolvers
///   cannot cross-contaminate through the shared container. The adapter consumes
///   only `reasoningConfig` from the resolved value. Stop tokens come from the
///   loaded `ModelConfiguration` (`extraEOSTokens` / `eosTokenIds`), and
///   tool-call format and identity (`id` / `tokenizerSource` / `modelDirectory`)
///   are likewise taken from `context.configuration` (read at load time before
///   resolution) — so patching `extraEOSTokens`, `eosTokenIds`, `toolCallFormat`,
///   or any identity field in a resolver is inert. Carry extra stop tokens in the
///   model configuration itself, not via a resolver.
///
/// Composition follows the same `any Protocol`-injected-at-init convention as
/// ``Downloader`` / ``TokenizerLoader`` in `MLXLMCommon`, with a trivial default
/// (``DefaultConfigurationResolver``) wired up by ``MLXLanguageModel``'s
/// convenience init so the common case stays zero-config. The ``default`` static
/// sugar is provided here for ergonomic call sites.
