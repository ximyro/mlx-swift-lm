#  Evaluation

The simplified LLM/VLM API allows you to load a model and evaluate prompts with only a few lines of code.

For example, this loads a model and asks a question and a follow-on question:

```swift
let model = try await loadModel(
    using: TokenizersLoader(),
    id: "mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit"
)
let session = ChatSession(model)
print(try await session.respond(to: "What are two things to see in San Francisco?"))
print(try await session.respond(to: "How about a great place to eat?"))
```

The second question actually refers to information (the location) from the first
question -- this context is maintained inside the `ChatSession` object.

If you need a one-shot prompt/response simply create a `ChatSession`, evaluate
the prompt and discard.  Multiple `ChatSession` instances could also be used
(at the cost of the memory in the `KVCache`) to handle multiple streams of
context.

## Streaming Output

The previous example produced the entire response in one call.  Often
users want to see the text as it is generated -- you can do this with
a stream:

```swift
let model = try await loadModel(
    using: TokenizersLoader(),
    id: "mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit"
)
let session = ChatSession(model)

for try await item in session.streamResponse(to: "Why is the sky blue?") {
    print(item, terminator: "")
}
print()
```

## Structured Chat Continuation

`ChatSession` can also continue from structured `Chat.Message` values. This
is useful for agent loops that consume tool calls from `streamDetails(to:role:images:videos:)`
and then append one or more `.tool` messages without rebuilding the whole
conversation history:

```swift
var pendingToolCalls: [ToolCall] = []
var rejectedToolCall: RejectedToolCall?

for try await item in session.streamDetails(
    to: "What is the weather in Paris?",
    images: [],
    videos: []
) {
    if case .toolCall(let toolCall) = item {
        pendingToolCalls.append(toolCall)
    }
    if case .rejectedToolCall(let rejection) = item {
        rejectedToolCall = rejection
    }
}

if let rejectedToolCall {
    throw RejectedToolCallError(rejectedToolCall)
}

var toolResults: [Chat.Message] = []
for toolCall in pendingToolCalls {
    let toolResult = try await callTool(toolCall)
    toolResults.append(.tool(toolResult))
}

if !toolResults.isEmpty {
    let answer = try await session.respond(to: toolResults)
    print(answer)
}
```

`Generation.toolCall` contains only parsed and authorized calls that may be
considered for dispatch. Tool-call-shaped output that is malformed, incomplete,
or names an undeclared function is emitted separately as
`Generation.rejectedToolCall`; rejected protocol is never returned as a normal
response chunk. `rawTextPreview` is bounded for diagnostics but can contain
sensitive argument values, so applications should not log or persist it
automatically.

The example buffers accepted calls until the generation finishes. This makes
dispatch atomic at the turn level: if a later call in the same model output is
rejected, no earlier call has already caused an external side effect.

When `ChatSession` builds its cache from messages, it retains the structured
transcript and renders the complete conversation for every continuation, as
required by conversation-aware chat templates. When the rendered tokens extend
the tokens already represented by the session's KV cache, only the new suffix
is prefilled. Both the string-and-role overloads and the structured-message
overloads use this same retained-conversation and cache-reuse path. If a
template rewrites an earlier part of the prompt, the session rewinds to a
verified common prefix when the cache and input can be trimmed safely.
Otherwise, it rebuilds the cache rather than combining stale model state with a
mismatched prompt.

The low-level initializers that accept an existing raw KV cache cannot recover
the messages used to create it. Those initializers preserve fragment-based
continuation behavior; use the history initializer when a structured
conversation must be resumed.

When a session is initialized with history, the first generation must prefill
that history to create a KV cache. Reuse the same `ChatSession` so later tool
turns can take the suffix-only fast path.

## VLMs (Vision Language Models)

This same API supports VLMs as well.  Simply present the image or video
to the `ChatSession`:

```swift
let model = try await loadModel(
    using: TokenizersLoader(),
    id: "mlx-community/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct-4bit"
)
let session = ChatSession(model)

let answer1 = try await session.respond(
    to: "what kind of creature is in the picture?",
    image: .url(URL(fileURLWithPath: "support/test.jpg"))
)
print(answer1)

// we can ask a followup question referring back to the previous image
let answer2 = try await session.respond(
    to: "What is behind the dog?"
)
print(answer2)
```

## Advanced Usage

The `ChatSession` has a number of parameters you can supply when creating it:

- **instructions**: optional instructions to the chat session, e.g. describing what type of responses to give
    - for example you might instruct the language model to respond in rhyme or
        talking like a famous character from a movie
    - or that the responses should be very brief
- **generateParameters**: parameters that control the generation of output, e.g. token limits and temperature
    - see `GenerateParameters`
- **processing**: optional media processing instructions
