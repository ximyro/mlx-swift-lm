/// A genuine cold-fetch of a small model through the production `HubClient`
/// path, asserting availability moves absent -> `.available` across the download.
///
/// This is the counterpart to `HuggingFaceLanguageModelMacroSmoke`, which is
/// deliberately network-free. Here we DO hit the network, so the suite is
/// opt-in behind the `MLX_RUN_COLD_FETCH` environment flag and never runs in a
/// default sweep. Enable it explicitly by setting `MLX_RUN_COLD_FETCH=1` (on
/// device, `TEST_RUNNER_MLX_RUN_COLD_FETCH=1`, which Xcode forwards to the test
/// runner process).
///
/// Forcing "cold" correctly means controlling the loader's cache, not the
/// availability observer:
///
/// - The DOWNLOADER's cache decides cold-vs-warm. We hand `#hubDownloader(_:)`
///   a `HubClient` backed by a throwaway `HubCache` rooted in a fresh temp
///   directory, so nothing is present and the fetch must go to the network.
/// - `weightsLocation:` is only the availability observer. It MUST resolve
///   against that SAME throwaway cache; otherwise download and availability
///   look at different directories — precisely the mismatch the production
///   `HubCache`-based resolver was introduced to fix. Pointing it at a bogus or
///   default path would fake "not downloaded" without forcing a fetch, so it is
///   the wrong lever.
/// - The process-global in-memory `ModelCache` is the other confound: if some
///   other test already loaded this model, `loadContainer()` would return the
///   cached instance and never touch our throwaway cache. `evictAll()` before
///   the load, plus `.serialized` and isolated invocation, keeps the fetch cold.
